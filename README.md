## 📌 Introduction

This repository was developed to support an application-based Python seminar that tackles the TCP/IP model's transport layer. As a result of improving TCP-based client-server applications, you will be applying the core networking principles that you were introduced to during the workshop.By the end of this project, participants would have worked with API data and adopted simple TCP connectivity alongside considered encryption methods that secure network interactions.

## 📝 Exercises Overview

- Understanding the TCP/IP Model's Transport Layer. 
- The distinctions that exist between TCP and UDP and the uses that they have. 
- Python programming for UDP interaction between clients and servers. 
- Encryption of information for maximum security. Fetching environmental data directly from an API followed by transferring it over UDP. 
- Dealing with errors in communication in addition to integrating essential retransmission logic for usage.
## 🚀 Installation and Usage

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

- Required Python libraries:

```pip install cryptography requests ```

- A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm) or terminal.
